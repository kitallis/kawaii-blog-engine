## Kawaii Blog Engine

### Why does this exist

This project exists because I need to practice my golang skills and because the world can use yet another blog engine out there.

### Persistence

We plan to use sqlite as a persistence layer to enable a two file (go binary and sqlite data) drop in any server to start running this blog engine.
